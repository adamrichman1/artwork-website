        "I am a Graphic Designer and Artist in New Jersey. Iâ€™m currently a student at The College of New Jersey with a Graphic Design Major and graduating the year 2022.",
        "My work ranges from a comic book style of art to more design-based works using the Adobe Suite. Growing up, most of my work consisted of me drawing on paper with pencil then coloring with colored pencils and markers. As I became more of a Graphic Designer, I started to learn, use, and master a lot of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign for my work, while still maintaining my traditional methods of artmaking.",
