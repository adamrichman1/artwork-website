    "description": [
        "I am a Graphic Designer and Artist from New Jersey. I’m currently a student at The College of New Jersey with a Graphic Design major, graduating in the year 2022.",
        "My work ranges from a comic book style of art to more design-based work using the Adobe Suite. Growing up, most of my art consisted of me drawing on paper with pencil and then coloring it with colored pencils and markers. As I became more of a Graphic Designer, I started to learn and master Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign for my work, while still maintaining my traditional methods of art-making.",
